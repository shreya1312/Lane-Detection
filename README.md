# Lane Detection

## Introduction
Lane Detection is a computer vision project that identifies and highlights lanes on a road from images or video streams using classical image processing techniques. It is a critical component of autonomous vehicles and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). This README provides a brief overview of the Lane Detection project.

## Features
- **Lane Identification**: The system identifies and highlights the lanes on the road using classical image processing techniques.
- **Real-time Detection**: Lane detection can be performed in real-time, making it suitable for use in autonomous vehicles and driver assistance systems.
- **Lane Markings**: The system detects and follows lane markings, such as solid and dashed lines.
- **Lane Departure Warning**: Lane Detection can be used to provide warnings when a vehicle deviates from its lane without signaling.

## Getting Started
1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have the necessary software libraries and dependencies installed, including OpenCV.

2. **Data Input**: The Lane Detection system can take input from various sources, such as images or video streams. Configure the system to access the desired input.

3. **Detection Algorithm**: Implement classical image processing techniques for lane detection, such as color thresholding, edge detection, and line detection.

4. **Parameter Tuning**: Adjust the parameters of the image processing techniques to achieve optimal results for the specific road conditions and camera setup.

5. **Visualization**: Implement a visualization component to display the detected lanes on the input frames.

6. **Integration**: Integrate the Lane Detection system with your vehicle's control system or user interface as needed.
